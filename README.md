## Welcome to impulse
impulse is a Garry's Mod Framework that can be tailored to nearly anything. With performance, aesthetic, and accessibility at the core of the design,
the sky is the limit for what you can do.

## Security
Security is the backbone of impulse. Networking and client data handling has been carefully crafted to keep troublemakers at bay.
----  
If you operate a large server using the impulse framework, or want to switch to it, please send an email to `nick@landis-community.com` for
access to the impulse Anti-Cheat 2.0, which features cross database references across any server with the anti-cheat.

## Performance
impulse has been optimized to the bit for maximum performance. Servers can expect to achieve 128 players concurrently (given proper moderation and
a well constructed schema) without major issues.
